# clockpie
Clock divided into parts looking like pie chart. That's the reason for the name, looks like pie chart, but it's for clock.

In my case i used it for visualizing the division of day into some prices for service. There are 2 classes
- ClockPie - which is static and can draw the clock divided into parts (pies)
- AnimatedClockPie - extension of the static class that is able to animate the division
